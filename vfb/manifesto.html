        <h1>THE WIND-BREAKER'S MANIFESTO</h1>
        <h2>by pullmyf1nger69</h2>
        <p>
            We believe that it is the right of every digesting being to fart openly, loudly and freely.
            No just society can exist in which this natural right is denied.
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            We have found it necessary in the wake of the calamitous outcome of the inter-planetary supreme court case of “Smelt It V. Dealt It” to organize against the forces of flatulent suppression. For in the 7 galactic cycles since its precedent was set we have seen a continual erosion of our rights of flatus expression. For now we break wind at the risk of our very lives! We shall not rest as long as our brothers, sisters and non-gendered relations face public vaporization at the hands of a government so determined to crush the human spirit as to suppress our most sacred of rights. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <br>
            We have created Virtual Fart-Butt to give every individual and hive-being the chance to once again feel the freedom that comes from loudly expressing gas from their hindquarters (or frontquarters in the case of our Cydgleptian comrades). Our hope is that this virtual taste of freedom might stoke within the hearts of all the fires of revolution. Digesters of the galaxy, we have nothing to lose but our chains! For now our movement is but a soft rumbling in hidden back rooms and behind closed door. But soon will come the day that the seats of galactic power will tremble and shake before the broken wind of free beings, untethered, farting free!
